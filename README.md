This is the personal playground of Janice Karin and likely not of interest to the general public. This area may be used to experiment with new tools or for whatever other purpose Janice wishes.

At the current time, Janice is beta testing a new documentation tool called [Scripta](http://scripta.io) and is using this space to compare markdown and the scripta markup and to help illustrate issues she finds for the Scripta developer.
