This file is for experimenting with markdown

```
this is code
*this is more code*
**_this is even more code_**
_so is this_
**and this**
```

* **this is bold**
* _this is italics_
* *so is this*
* **_this is bold italics_**
* _**so is this**_

This is how I escape a character \*at least I hope so!\**foo*
